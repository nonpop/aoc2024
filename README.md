# AoC 2024 in Gleam

Solutions to all stars of [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), although a few require some
manual steps and/or may not be completely generic. All code written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
(version 1.6.1).

This is just me learning Gleam and having some fun. For good/clever/fast code, look elsewhere.

To run, say `gleam run -m <day> <part> <input>`, for example

    gleam run -m day1 1 day1_large.txt
